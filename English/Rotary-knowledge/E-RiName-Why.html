								<p> The Chinese term for "Rotary Club" was only introduced in 1921-22.</p>
							<p> In the summer of 1919, the Americans in Shanghai started the "Rotary Club", an American-styled professional and businessmen's association in the Shanghai Public Concession, but without a Chinese name to it, and the 37 founding members of the Rotary Club of Shanghai were all American citizens. When the Chinese-language newspaper in Shanghai reported on the organisation, it was not given any Chinese name but according to the characteristics of the organisation, it was called a "rotating club" or "cyclical fellowship association".
 </p>
							<p>  In 1920, the Rotary Club of Shanghai began accepting Chinese members. The Club believed that it should open up to the vast majority of Chinese in the city and expand its organisation. Therefore, it was necessary to use Chinese and the establishment of its Chinese name was the first priority. </p>
							<p>In 1921, two of the Club’s Chinese members, Dr. Zhengting Wang and Dr. Fuzhao Yu, proposed to use the Chinese word "扶轮" (pronounced as fu-lun) from the ancient Chinese books and use the Chinese name “扶轮社” after the Rotary Club. The Chinese words “扶轮” means support, protection, charity and service in the Chinese culture. It is similar to the aims and vision of professionalism, goodwill, fraternity and peace from the Rotary Clubs in the United States. Even the Rotary emblem of a wagon wheel matched its Chinese name. Thus, "上海扶轮社" was decided to be the Chinese name for the Rotary Club of Shanghai.</p>
