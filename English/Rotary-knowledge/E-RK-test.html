							<p> Early Rotarians emphasised the need for highly ethical and responsible actions by Rotarians and using professional knowledge and skills in service. What is unique about Rotarians is their ability to deliver on their commitments no matter how bold the promise is. In 1932, Herb Taylor (a member of the Rotary Club of Chicago and President of the 1954-55 Rotary International) launched The Four-Way Test as an attempt to save his crumbling Club Aluminum Company of Chicago. Later, Rotary adopted this Four-Way Test that emphasise the value of "integrity". Since then, The Four-Way Test has become the ethical guidelines that Rotarians faithfully adhere to in their personal and professional relationships.  </p>
